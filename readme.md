Originally it was rather simple set of scripts, now a sorta system. Rather cumbersome.
# USAGE
`python -m pip install seleniumbase dotenv requests`
`python main_checker.py`
Checks 2 cities that are written inside of `vfs_...` scripts.
# EXPLANATION
```
vfs_checkdates("https://visa.vfsglobal.com/kaz/en/fra/login","Almaty","Astana","–§—Ä–∞ –ê–ª–º","–§—Ä–∞ –ê—Å—Ç")
```
The script checks for two cities (TODO rewrite city args as an array) and sends closest available date(if available) to TG chat. abbreviations example: for Visa center of France in Moscow, write "Fra Msk" (XXX YYY)
